# Telemetry Radios/Modems

Telemetry Radios can (optionally) be used to provide a wireless MAVLink connection between a ground control station like *QGroundControl* and a vehicle running PX4. This makes it possible to tune parameters while a vehicle is in flight, inspect telemetry in real-time, change a mission on the fly, etc.

PX4 supports a number of types of telemetry radios:
* [SiK Radio](../telemetry/sik_radio.md) based firmware (more generally, any radio with a UART interface should work).
  * [RFD900 Telemetry Radio](../telemetry/rfd900_telemetry.md)
  * [HolyBro (SIK) Telemetry Radio](../telemetry/holybro_sik_radio.md)
  * <del>*HKPilot Telemetry Radio*</del> (Discontinued)
  * <del>*3DR Telemetry Radio*</del> (Discontinued)
* [Telemetry Wifi](../telemetry/telemetry_wifi.md)
* [Microhard Serial Telemetry Radio](../telemetry/microhard_serial.md)
* XBee Serial Telemetry Radio
  * [HolyBro XBP9X Telemetry Radio](../telemetry/holybro_xbp9x_radio.md)
* CUAV Serial Telemetry Radio
  * [CUAV P8 Telemetry Radio](../telemetry/cuav_p8_radio.md)

PX4 is protocol compatible with [SiK Radio](../telemetry/sik_radio.md) and will generally work out of the box (though you may need to change/use an appropriate connector).

WiFi telemetry typically has shorter range, higher data rates, and makes it easier to support FPV/video feeds.
One benefit of WiFi radios is that you only need to purchase a single radio unit for your vehicle (assuming the ground station already has WiFi).

:::note
PX4 does not support connecting an LTE USB module to the flight controller (and sending MAVLink traffic via the Internet).
You can however connect an LTE module to a companion computer and use it to route MAVLink traffic from the flight controller.
